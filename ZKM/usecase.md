**My proposed usecase using ZKM Entagled and HYbrid rollups**
 Proposed Use Case: Supply Chain Verification in Agriculture 
To make sure that the agriculture supply chain is transparent, traceable, and efficient. We can implement ZKM's Entangled Rollups and Hybrid Rollups to the level of agricultural supply chains from farm production to retail.
ZKM uses Entangled Rollups to connect different stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain—farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers. The data and transactions of each participant are stored securely and openly on different platforms worldwide.For example, a farm’s organic certification and production data can be verified by a processing plant and then passed on to the retailers, which authenticates the claims without disclosing any confidential information.
Hybrid Rollups compile and transfer huge amounts of data and transactions in the agricultural supply chain. By combining multiple proofs into a single proof, ZKM cuts down on the computational time and the cost of verifying each transaction separately.  The aggregation means that the data o
ion of calculations in a timely and cost-effective manner.
