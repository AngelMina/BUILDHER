# **My proposed usecase using ZKM Entangled and Hybrid rollups**
## Proposed Use Case: Decentralized Supply Chain Management
The application of ZKMâ€™s Entangled Rollups and Hybrid Rollups in the decentralized supply chain management system can result in the enhancement of visibility, security, and efficiency of global supply networks. The system uses Entangled Rollups to ensure seamless communication between different blockchain networks used by various parties in the supply chain. For example, a shipment's status recorded on one blockchain (such as Ethereum) can be verified and updated on another blockchain (like Hyperledger or a custom supply chain network) without compromising data integrity. This cross-chain feature allows for precise monitoring and confirmation of goods moving in distinct stages and on various networks.
 Hybrid Rollups handle the aggregation and verification of supply chain transactions. The movement updates, the status, and the conditions of many goods can be grouped together via a single proof strip which will be validated on the main blockchain among the others. This leads to the reduction in the computational load and transaction costs associated with managing numerous individual entries. Users can choose between immediate updates (with higher fees) or batch updates (with lower costs), depending on their needs.
